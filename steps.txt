Build a responsive Hero Slider section for a juice product website using React.

GOAL:
Create a dynamic, animated hero section that displays different juice flavors with interactive navigation.

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- The hero section contains 3 horizontal columns using flex layout.
- Layout structure:
  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
- The section must be fully responsive.

COLUMN 1 (Left):
- Contains two stacked images (flex-direction: column).
- Images animate from bottom to top.
- Use AOS library.
- Animation type: fade-up.

COLUMN 2 (Center / Main Product):
- Contains the main product can image centered.
- Below the can image:
  - Left arrow button
  - "Shop Now" button
  - Right arrow button
- Entire column animates with opacity transition from 0 to 1.
- Use AOS animation type: fade-in.

COLUMN 3 (Right):
- Same structure as Column 1.
- Two stacked images (vertical).
- Same animation: fade-up using AOS.

BACKGROUND BEHAVIOR:
- Hero section background color changes dynamically based on selected flavor.
- Background color comes from flavor.backgroundColor.
- Transition between colors must be smooth.

BEHIND FLAVOR TEXT:
- Large flavor name text positioned absolutely behind the 3 columns.
- Lower z-index than columns.
- When right arrow is clicked → text slides from right to left.
- When left arrow is clicked → text slides from left to right.
- Use CSS transform (translateX) with smooth transition.

SLIDER LOGIC:
When an arrow button is clicked:
1. Update selected flavor state.
2. Update:
   - Background color
   - Main can image
   - Side images
   - Behind flavor text
3. Re-trigger animations properly.

Ensure clean component structure and proper state management.
